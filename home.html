                    <br>2 cups of mixed fruits (such as grapes, strawberries, pineapple, mandarin
                    oranges, and kiwi),

                    <br>1 cup of miniature marshmallows
                    <br>1 cup of whipped cream or whipped topping
                    <br>1/2 cup of Greek yogurt (plain or vanilla flavored)
                    <br>1 tablespoon of honey (optional, adjust to taste)

                    <br>Prepare the Fruits: Wash and chop the fruits into bite-sized pieces if they
                    are not already prepared.

                    <br>Mix Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, combine the chopped fruits and
                    miniature marshmallows.

                    <br>Prepare Dressing: In a separate bowl, mix together the whipped cream or
                    whipped topping with
                    <br>Greek yogurt. If you prefer a sweeter salad, you can add honey to the
                    dressing and adjust the
                    <br>sweetness to your taste.

                    <br>1 ripe avocado
                    <br>2 slices of bread (your choice, but sourdough or whole grain work well)
                    <br>Salt and pepper to taste
                    <br>Optional toppings: sliced tomatoes, red pepper flakes, sesame seeds, poached egg, feta
                    cheese, etc. <br>

                    <br><span style="font-size: 30px;">Instructions: </span><br>

                    <br>Start by toasting your bread to your desired level of crispiness.
                    <br>While the bread is toasting, cut the avocado in half and remove the pit. Scoop the avocado
                    flesh
                    <br>into a bowl and mash it with a fork until it reaches your desired consistency.
                    <br>Once the bread is toasted, spread the mashed avocado evenly onto each slice.
                    <br>Sprinkle salt and pepper over the avocado to taste.
                    <br>Now, it's time to add your optional toppings. Get creative and add whatever you like! Some
                    <br>popular choices include sliced tomatoes, red pepper flakes, sesame seeds, a poached egg, or
                    <br>crumbled feta cheese.

                    <br>Lettuce
                    <br>Tomatoes, sliced
                    <br>Cucumbers, sliced
                    <br>Bell peppers, sliced
                    <br>Red onions, sliced

                    <br>Cheese slices (optional, if you're not vegan)
                    <br>Salt and pepper to taste
                    <br>Condiments of your choice (mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup, etc.)
                    <br>Seasonings like oregano, basil, or Italian seasoning (optional)

                    <br><span style="font-size: 30px;">Instructions:</span><br>

                    <br>Start by slicing the sub rolls horizontally, but not all the way through, to
                    <br>create a pocket for the fillings.
                    <br>If you like your bread toasted, you can lightly toast the rolls in the oven or toaster.
                    <br>Spread your desired condiments inside the bread, such as mayonnaise, mustard, or any
                    <br>other sauce you prefer.
                    <br>Layer the veggies inside the sandwich. You can start with lettuce as the base, followed by
                    tomatoes,
                    <br>cucumbers, bell peppers, onions, olives, pickles, and avocado slices if using.
                    <br>If you're adding cheese, place a slice or two on top of the veggies.
                    <br>Season with salt, pepper, and any other desired seasonings like oregano or basil.
                    <br>Close the sandwich and press down gently to help the flavors meld together.
                    <br>You can serve the sandwich immediately or wrap it in parchment paper or foil for later.

                    <br><span style="font-size: 30px;">Ingredients:</span><br>

                    <br><b>Cooking Rice:</b><br>

                    <br>Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch.
                    <br>In a pot, bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Add the rinsed rice, reduce heat to low, cover, and
                    cook
                    <br>until the rice is tender and water is absorbed, about 15-20 minutes. Once done, fluff the rice
                    with
                    <br>a fork and set it aside to cool slightly. <br>
                    <br><b>Tempering:</b><br>

                    <br>Heat oil in a large skillet or pan over medium heat. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter.
                    <br>Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds.
                    <br>Now add green chilies, peanuts or cashews (if using), and curry leaves. Saute until the nuts
                    turn
                    <br>light golden brown. <br>
                    <br><b>Mixing:</b><br>

                    <br>Add the cooked rice to the skillet. Gently mix everything together, ensuring the rice is coated
                    <br>evenly with the spices. Be careful not to break the rice grains. <br>
                    <br><b>Adding Lemon Juice:</b><br>

                    <br>Squeeze fresh lemon juice over the rice. Start with 1 tablespoon and adjust according to your
                    taste
                    <br>preferences. Mix well. <br>
                    <br><b>Final Touch:</b>

                    <br>Season with salt to taste. Mix again and cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to
                    meld together.

                    <br>8 ounces (about 225 grams) of spaghetti pasta
                    <br>2 tablespoons of olive oil
                    <br>3 cloves of garlic, minced
                    <br>1 small onion, finely chopped
                    <br>1 can (14.5 ounces) of diced tomatoes
                    <br>1 teaspoon of dried basil
                    <br>1 teaspoon of dried oregano
                    <br>Salt and pepper to taste
                    <br>Grated Parmesan cheese for serving (optional)

                    <br><span style="font-size: 30px;">Instructions</span>:<br>

                    <br>Cook the spaghetti pasta according to the package instructions in a large pot of boiling salted
                    <br>water until al dente. Drain the pasta and set aside.

                    <br>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and chopped
                    onion,
                    <br>and sauté until softened and fragrant, about 2-3 minutes.

                    <br>Stir in the diced tomatoes, dried basil, and dried oregano. Season with salt and pepper to
                    taste.
                    <br>Let the sauce simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened.

                    <br>Add the cooked spaghetti pasta to the skillet with the tomato sauce. Toss well to coat the pasta
                    <br>evenly with the sauce.

                    <br>Serve the spaghetti pasta hot, garnished with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh basil leaves if
                    desired.

                    <br><span style="font-size: 30px;">Ingredients:</span><br>

                    <br>1 cup all-purpose flour
                    <br>2 tablespoons sugar
                    <br>1 tablespoon baking powder

                    <br>1 cup milk
                    <br>2 tablespoons melted butter (or vegetable oil)
                    <br>1 large egg
                    <br>Optional: 1 teaspoon vanilla extract <br>

                    <br><span style="font-size: 30px;">Instructions:</span><br>

                    <br>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
                    <br>In another bowl, whisk together the milk, melted butter (or oil), egg, and vanilla extract (if
                    using).
                    <br>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. It's okay if the
                    <br>batter is a little lumpy; overmixing can result in tough pancakes.
                    <br>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. You can lightly grease the surface with
                    butter
                    <br>or cooking spray if needed.
                    <br>Once the skillet is hot, pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook
                    until
                    <br>bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.
                    <br>Carefully flip the pancakes with a spatula and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until
                    golden
                    <br>brown on the bottom.
                    <br>Transfer the cooked pancakes to a plate and repeat with the remaining batter. You can keep the
                    <br>pancakes warm in a low oven while you cook the rest.
                    <br>Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, whipped
                    <br>cream, or chocolate chips.

                    <br>Prepare the Paneer: If the paneer is not already crumbled or sliced, prepare it accordingly. You
                    can
                    <br>crumble it with your hands or cut it into thin slices.

                    <br>Prepare the Bread: Take two slices of bread for each sandwich. You can use any type of bread you
                    <br>prefer, whether it's white, whole wheat, or multigrain.

                    <br><b>Layer the Sandwich:</b><br>

                    <br>Spread butter or ghee evenly on one side of each bread slice.
                    <br>Place a few slices or a generous amount of crumbled paneer on one slice of bread.
                    <br>Top the paneer with thinly sliced onion, tomato, and green chilies (if using).
                    <br>Sprinkle some chopped coriander leaves over the vegetables.
                    <br>Optionally, sprinkle a pinch of chaat masala for added flavor.
                    <br>Season with salt and pepper according to your taste.
                    <br>Assemble the Sandwich: Place the other slice of bread on top of the paneer and vegetable layer,
                    with
                    <br>the buttered side facing down.<br>

                    <br><b>Cook the Sandwich: You have a few options for cooking the sandwich:</b><br>

                    <br><b>Grill :</b> Preheat a sandwich maker or grill pan. Place the assembled sandwich on the grill
                    and cook
                    <br>until the bread turns golden brown and crispy, and the paneer filling is heated through.
                    <br><b>Pan Fry:</b> Heat a skillet or frying pan over medium heat. Place the assembled sandwich in
                    the pan and
                    <br>cook on both sides until golden brown and crispy, pressing gently with a spatula to ensure even
                    cooking.

                    <br>Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add chopped onions, garlic, ginger, and green chili. Sauté until
                    <br>onions turn translucent.

                    <br>Add chopped vegetables (carrots, cabbage, bell peppers, beans, peas, etc.). Stir fry for 5-7 minutes
                    <br>until the vegetables are cooked but still crisp.

                    <br>Add soy sauce, vinegar, chili sauce, and salt to taste. Mix well and cook for another 2-3 minutes.
                    <br>Remove from heat and let the filling cool down.

                    <br>Place a spoonful of the vegetable filling in the center of each dough circle. Fold the sides over
                    <br>the filling and roll tightly to form a cylinder-shaped roll. Seal the edges using a little water.
